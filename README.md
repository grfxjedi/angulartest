# TurnCommerce Angular Test

Angular 7 app

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Node.js installed on your development machine.

* For Node.js and NPM, I prefer to use the [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). This project was built using Node v8.11.3 and NPM v6.9.0
* **OR** you can download and install Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.


## Local dependencies
From the project directory run:

```
$ npm install
```

After that you should be able to build and run locally.

## Build & development

Run `npm start` for building preview locally. The project will be served locally on port 8080. Building will launch a window in your default browser to [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)
